## Download
You can download the class materials using the following command line.

	$ git clone https://github.com/wanirepo/Stats_2021Spring.git

Once you clone the github repository, you can just type the following command to get the updated github repository. 

	$ git pull
	
Or you can download the repository as a zip file or you can also use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). The class materials will be uploaded (e.g., lecture slides, assignments) before each class. 

There is a good github tutorial: [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html)

## What are the aims of this course?

Data are everywhere. Data science already became a key element in many research and industrial areas. The primary aim of this course is to learn basic concepts and skills for data analysis, including concepts of random variables, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, linear modeling, data visualization, etc., preparing you for your life after the graduation in this data-are-everywhere age. However, this is not the only aim of this class. Statistics goes beyond just data analysis, I believe. Statistics is a way of thinking and reasoning. It helps with scientific reasoning and critical thinking. Thus, I hope this class could provide you with some useful tips for scientific thinking and reasoning. 

## Course format (flipped classroom, but the modification due to covid-19) and expectations

This class was originally designed as a flipped classroom format, which is a new way of teaching and learning. Different from the traditional learning environment (passively listening to the lecture in the class and doing homework at home), in the flipped classroom, you will listen to the lecture at home and do homework and practices in the classroom. I personally experienced this format of learning during my PhD (for the Machine Learning class) and deeply enjoyed it. I found the flipped classroom helped students stay engaged and provided a good environment for hands-on experience. 

But unfortunately, due to the covid situation, we might not be able to use the flipped classroom format. Last year, I found watching the pre-recorded lecture videos together and provide you with in-depth explanation about the content was quite effective. Thus I will use the same approach this year. I will share the lecture videos in advance, but we will watch it together using the livestream format (I will use youtube). Most of the videos will be in English, but I will provide additional explanation in Korean. 

In the middle of the class, there will be pop-quizes. This is important because I will use this for the attendance check. I will explain this in more detail below. 

To be successful in this online class format, the smooth communication is very important. Therefore, we will use [slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-kr/) for the class communication. I will upload youtube livestream links and class materials in the slack. I will share the slack invitation link through the email before the first week of the class. 


## Textbooks

Main textbook: <br>
>"Stats: Data and Models" by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock

Supplements: <br>
>"Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century" by Russ Poldrack [Link](http://statsthinking21.org/)
<br>"Seeing theory" [Link](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/index.html#firstPage)
<br>"The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom" by Stephen M. Stigler [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Pillars-Statistical-Wisdom/dp/0674088913/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505049565&sr=8-1&keywords=seven+pillars+of+statistical+wisdom)
<br>"History of Statistics Reading Group" (CMU) [Link](http://stat.cmu.edu/~lrichard/history-of-stats/history-of-stats.html)


## Softwares

Teaching how to use statistics packages or programming is not the main focus of this class. This class is more about statistical methods and theories. However, software packages and computer programming are actually essential in learning statistics. Therefore, I will provide two lectures about new software packages for statistical analysis, [JAMOVI](https://www.jamovi.org/) and [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/). These are brand-new and open-source tools for statistical analysis. In addition, I might use Matlab, Python, or R sometimes. You can download Matlab through SKKU. Python and R are open-source programming languages. There will be "Biostats and Bigdata 2" next semester in which you can learn more about JAMOVI.  

## TAs

TBD


## Evaluation

Absolute evaluation will be used for this course. 

1. Attendance (40%)
2. Participation (including pop-questions) (35%)
3. Final exam (25%)

For the attendance, I will use the pop-quiz (using google form), which will happen 2-3 times during the class. You have to submit your answers after I posted the link for quiz in the chatting, and for the attendance check, I will see the time you submitted your answers.
